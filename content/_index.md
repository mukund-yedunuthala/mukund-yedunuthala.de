I am a Computational Engineering specialist with a Master’s degree from TU Bergakademie Freiberg, Germany, and a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Osmania University, India. Since 2019, I've been living in Germany, gaining expertise in high-performance simulations, particularly in Finite Element Analysis (FEA). My focus areas include continuum mechanics, numerical modeling, and scientific computing, with proficiency in Python and C++. Below, you’ll find a selection of my projects that showcase how I apply these skills.
