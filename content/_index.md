I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computational Materials Science at the TU Bergakademie Freiberg in Freiberg, Germany. Originally from Hyderabad, Telangana, India, I have been residing in Germany since 2019. I have a strong command of both German and English, allowing me to effectively communicate in bilingual settings.
