I am currently studying for a Master's degree in Computational Materials Science at TU Bergakademie Freiberg in Freiberg, Germany. I am from Hyderabad, Telangana, India, and have been living in Germany since 2019. I am proficient in both English and German, enabling me to communicate effectively in bilingual environments.
