I am currently studying for a Master's degree in **Computational Materials Science** at TU Bergakademie Freiberg, Germany. I am from Hyderabad, India, and have been living in Germany since 2019. I specialize in continuum (solid) mechanics, and scientific computing in Python. This is where I list some of my notable projects.
